# Shazaq's mind blowers
After countless days of procrastination justified by a search for a web design that was barebones yet effective, came that October afternoon. With a loud thunderstorm holding the entire city hostage, what better time to start a new project? It eventually took me a few more weeks of work â€”- so thinly distributed, it would put graphene to shame.

With an affinity for nitpicking and not nearly enough interest to study UI/UX, I decided to _take inspiration_&copy; (shamelessly rip off) from two different sources. Combining design elements from a retro site[^1] with tools used on a friend's site[^2], the pinnacle of website design was born.

I'll be using this site for -- Project and CTF write-ups, Blog posts on anything that interests me.
