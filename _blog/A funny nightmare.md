# A funny nightmare... well, funny in hindsight
I just woke up from a rather funny nightmare, i'm typing this draft in hopes of editing this later before pushing it(I won't, lol).
I go home with this gorgeous looking woman(don't ask me how i managed to pull it off), probably in her late 20s or early 30s. A two floor fancy villa. She guides me to her bedroom on the first floor.  *Have a seat, make yourself comfortable, i'll be right back with you.* - I have a seat on the edge of the bed and she locks herself in the Washroom(which 'looked' like a really fancy dressing closet for some reason). I must say, it was very uncharacteristic of me, but i'm thankful that I decided to snoop around the bedroom. I found some handcuffs right on top of the night stand that I somehow didn't notice till then. I felt my pants gradually getting tighter. I open the cupboard door which was right behind me, felt really easy to open as if something was pushing it from the other side. But before my brain could process, i was staring into the dead and bloodshot eyes of a corpse - rolled, pale and lifeless. I somehow manage to keep quiet(kinda proud of myself that i could be that stoic even at such a situation, at least i know that's what my brain thinks of myself). Tightness in my pants is completely gone and I start to sweat like the building's on fire. The corpse was now suspended with its upper torso out of the cupboard, a formal black leather belt was looped to its neck and attached to the back of the cupboard. I just notice the excessive use of room freshener - then it hit me(finally!) - *shit! this bitch is a psycho*  and definitely not in a kinky, sexy kinda way she's proper mental. Some Jeffrey Dahmer shit. Just as I am about to run out of the bedroom, I decide to turn back and lock the washroom door from the outside. I remember feeling proud of myself for coming up with that but it makes sense that the brain is starting to work now that a certain other body part isn't hoarding up all the blood. I quietly lock the bedroom from the outside as well. By the time I was  down to the main door on the ground floor, I could here her banging away at the door, she wasn't talking however, let alone scream for help she was just desperately trying to break free. I my mind it further confirms my theory and lock the door behind me and run into the city square two streets away. Out of breath and barely standing, I spot a patrol car and a cop standing by it. I make one last sprint with what i have left, now leaning on car(even my subconscious thinks my cardio is whack). The look on the officer's eye signalled he understood something was up. "*Calm down son, you are alright, talk to me*" (for some reason he sounded like Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon). Cut to black and a month later I'm interviewed for a Netflix Documentary as the only survivor. (Image for reference, its a pretty close match).![Aliens meme]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020250114054710.png)
Later I'm on the "Late Night with Conan O'Brien" TV show. Conan jokes about me running from a woman, "*Not sure if you ever had someone genuinely try to kill you, guy or a girl ,that shit is scary Conan, even a rock hard dick can't override that signal*".  
Overtime I slowly grow more and more paranoid, paying close attention to dark corners and scared of being alone, often find myself wandering the crowded city although watching every person walking past me, *It just might be her* . I walk into the distance as Micheal Jackson sings in the background *This girl is bad!, this girl is Dangerous*

I woke up in cold sweat, in the dark, only to be further scared by the pile of clothes on a chair right in front of me.
